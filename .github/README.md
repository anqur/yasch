# yasch

Some JSON Schema utilities for YAML, including:

* Converts any Go structs into a JSON Schema file
* A command line tool `yamlchk` for validating YAML files with a local JSON Schema file

You could also register those generated JSON Schema files into `.idea/jsonSchemas.xml` for autocompletion! See
also [Using schemas from JSON Schema Store].
